# Moe 
<u>M</u>otif C<u>o</u>-occurrenc<u>e</u> (Moe) is a tool to analyze motif co-occurrences in a set of peaks (ATAC, enhancer etc.). In addition, when compare the input data with background distal elements (summing 15 ENCODE cell types), Moe can identify significantly co-occuring motif pairs from the input peak set.
