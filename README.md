# MONet 
Motif Co-Occurrence Network analysis (MONet). is a tool to analyze motif co-occurrences in a set of peaks (ATAC, enhancer etc.). In addition, when compare the input data with background distal elements (summing 15 ENCODE cell types), Moe can identify significantly co-occuring motif pairs from the input peak set.

For questions on installation or usage, please open an issue, submit a pull request, or contact Rick Z. Li (zhl022@eng.ucsd.edu).
